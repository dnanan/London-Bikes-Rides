# London-Bikes-Rides
This dataset was downlaoded on Kaggle and in this project i made a dashboard using Tableau where i wanted to find:
- Moving Average by Moving Average Durange(Number of Days) and Moving Average Period(Days, Weeks, Months)
- The number of bikes rides between a specific period of time.
- The HeatMap of Temperature vs Wind Speed between a specific period of time counting the number of bike rides.
- Tne number of bikes count due to the weather.
- The numbr of bikes rides by hour.

# Python
- First of all I imported the dataset in python for making some data cleaning and analysis
- I made a count of unique values in the weather_code & season column.
- I changed the column name in a way that would be understandable then I changed the humidity values to percentage in the humidity_percent column.
- Then I made a season & weather dictionary so that we can map the integers to the actual written values.
- Finally I changed the dataset to an excel file to import it to Tableau.
